  <h1>What is this all about?</h1>

<p>Basically, this project is about making a game from scratch, from the logic of movement to the "graphics engine" of the game.

You have to learn how to work with textures, how to position them on the screen, and how to keep your projectorganized and clean. Following the rules of 42 School</p>

  <h1>What game is this?</h1>
</div>

<div align="center">
<p>My game follows the theme of the PAYDAY franchise. Where the "story" of the game is to steal things without using violence (basically, without using guns).

But watch your step! Some Cloakers are escorting the place... But don't worry, your friend Bain will guide you through the heist.</p>
